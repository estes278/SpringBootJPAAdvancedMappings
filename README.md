In this project, we explore the concept of Advanced Mappings with respect to database storage. We explored the use of mappings such as One to One, One to Many, Many to One, and Many to Many, as well as the various types of Cascading changes that can be applied to these relationships. We also covered the concept of Lazy vs Eager loading, where Eager retrieves all data related to the object upon initialization and Lazy only retrieves specifically what is asked for, when it is asked for. 

Additionally, we explored the specifics of a Join Table in a Many to Many relationship, where the Join Table stores mappings between “many” objects. This required a new set of annotations, such as @JoinColumn, which paired with the attributes joinColumns and inverseJoinColumns, where joinColumns refers to “this” class and inverse are the columns of the “other” class.
